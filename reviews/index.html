          <p>Keifers Cafe was quite the experience, I had heard
            good things about it from my colleagues, but I just
            had to find out for myself. First of all let me just
            say this, the views were out of this world!! I can't
            think of a better view of the Maui Coast. I ordered
            tuna steak and it did not dissapoint, It was obvious
            that the Tuna was fresh, the sauce was incredible, a
            a combination of seet with a little salty, the way it
            it complemented the tuna was perfect. Overall I
            would give Keifers Cafe a 9/10, I just told a couple
            of my freinds about it, they definitely know what they
            are doing here </p>

          <p>I grew up in Maui and during a trip home for the
            holidays I decided to try Keifers Cafe. Growing up
            here I loved the restaurants, and being major foodie
            always thought that there could be something better.
            Keifers restaurant blew my mind away, the took
            advantage of the beautiful landscape in an amazing
            way. Keifer was right about the food, I didn't think
            it was possible but the foot actually was better than
            the views! I decided to try the Lobster Pasta and
            it did not dissapoint, perhabs the best Lobster I
            have ever had in my entire life. The service was
            amazing our waiter really cared about us and made
            we had a great time. I would give Keifers Cafe a
            10/10</p>

          <p> I have spent alot of time touring the world reviewing
            restaurants with an emphasis in seafood, so when it
            comes to the overall quality of a seafood restuarant no one
            is a harsher critic than me. That being said, I fell in
            love with Keifers Cafe the second I stepped inside.
            The architecture of the builiding combined with the views
            was amazing. I ordered lobster burger, and absolutely
            loved it. It was cooked perfectly and the taste and texture
            of the lobster was incredible. The service was great, one
            of the best experiences I've had trying out a restaurant in
            a long time. I would give Keifers Cafe a 10/10. </p>
