        <p>Keifers Cafe was quite the experience, I had heard
          good things about it from my colleagues, but I just
          had to find out for myself. First of all let me just
          say this, the views were out of this world!! I can't
          think of a better view of the Maui Coast. I ordered
          tuna steak and it did not dissapoint, It was obvious
          that the Tuna was fresh, the sauce was incredible, a
          a combination of seet with a little salty, the way it
          it complemented the tuna was perfect. Overall I
          would give Keifers Cafe a 9/10, I just told a couple
          of my freinds about it, they definitely know what they
          are doing here </p>

        <p>I grew up in Maui and during a trip home for the
          holidays I decided to try Keifers Cafe. Growing up
          here I loved the restaurants, and being major foodie
          always thought that there could be something better.
          Keifers restaurant blew my mind away, the took
          advantage of the beautiful landscape in an amazing
          way. Keifer was right about the food, I didn't think
          it was possible but the foot actually was better than
          the views! I decided to try the Lobster Pasta and
          it did not dissapoint, perhabs the best Lobster I
          have ever had in my entire life. The service was
          amazing our waiter really cared about us and made
          we had a great time. I would give Keifers Cafe a
          10/10</p>

        <p> I have spent alot of time touring the world reviewing
          restaurants with an emphasis in seafood, so when it
          comes to the overall quality of a seafood restuarant no one
          is a harsher critic than me. That being said, I fell in
          love with Keifers Cafe the second I stepped inside.
          The architecture of the builiding combined with the views
          was amazing. I ordered lobster burger, and absolutely
          loved it. It was cooked perfectly and the taste and texture
          of the lobster was incredible. The service was great, one
          of the best experiences I've had trying out a restaurant in
          a long time. I would give Keifers Cafe a 10/10. </p>
